# Targeted Hospital Recommendation Algorithm

## Overview

This implementation adds a specialized "Targeted Recommendation" algorithm to the Hospital Location Analyzer. The algorithm focuses on user-provided AI location suggestions rather than relying solely on the advanced parameters or automated distribution of hospitals.

## Files Modified/Added

1. **targeted_algorithm.py** - New file containing the core algorithm logic for targeted recommendations
2. **implementation_guide.md** - Step-by-step guide for integrating the targeted algorithm into the main application

## How the Targeted Algorithm Works

Unlike the default "Indeterminate Recommendation" algorithm that evenly distributes hospitals across underserved areas, the Targeted algorithm:

1. **Prioritizes User Suggestions**: Uses the AI-processed location suggestions as the primary basis for hospital placement
2. **Optimizes Locations**: Adjusts suggested locations based on:
   - Proximity to medical coverage blind spots
   - Population density in the area
   - Minimum safe distance between hospitals
3. **Adds Supplementary Locations**: If needed, adds locations to cover high-population areas not served by the suggestions
4. **Ignores Advanced Parameters**: The algorithm doesn't use the form's advanced parameters, focusing entirely on suggestions

## Implementation Details

The algorithm implementation follows these key steps:

1. **Extracts Suggested Locations**: Processes the AI-analyzed location suggestions into coordinates
2. **Validates Suggestions**: Ensures coordinates are valid and within reasonable bounds
3. **Finds Coverage Gaps**: Identifies areas with high population that aren't covered by suggestions
4. **Optimizes Hospital Placement**: Places hospitals at the suggested locations plus any needed supplementary locations
5. **Ensures Minimum Distance**: Adjusts positions to maintain minimum distance between hospitals

## User Experience

From the user's perspective:

1. Select "Targeted Recommendation" in the Algorithm Type section
2. Enter natural language suggestions in the "AI Location Suggestions" field
   - Example: "Build two hospitals in North Sydney and one near Parramatta"
3. Submit the form
4. The algorithm will process the suggestions and generate optimized hospital locations
5. The results will be displayed with an analysis explaining how the suggestions were used

## Technical Implementation

The implementation required:

1. Creating a standalone algorithm module that can be easily maintained
2. Modifying the main app to check for algorithm_type and conditionally use the targeted algorithm
3. Ensuring proper error handling with fallback to the standard algorithm if needed
4. Providing an enhanced analysis that explains how suggestions were used

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to consider:

1. Adding more sophisticated location parsing for complex suggestions
2. Implementing visual indicators to show which recommendations came from suggestions
3. Adding a confidence score for each suggested location
4. Allowing users to specify hospital types in their suggestions
5. Providing real-time feedback as users type their suggestions

## How to Use

1. Make sure the `targeted_algorithm.py` file is in your project directory
2. Follow the instructions in `implementation_guide.md` to integrate the algorithm
3. Run the application and test using the targeted algorithm option
4. For best results, provide clear location suggestions in natural language
